# Single cell RNA sequencing analysis course
Scilifelab Solna, Rooms Air & Fire,  2019-02-04 - 2019-02-06

This course will cover the basic steps in single cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) processing and data analysis. Topics covered will include:

* An overview of the current scRNAseq techniques
* Basic overview of pipelines for processing raw reads into expression values
* Quality control of scRNAseq data
* Dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques
* Data normalization
* Differential gene expression for scRNAseq data
* Examples on how to use these tools in a research project.
